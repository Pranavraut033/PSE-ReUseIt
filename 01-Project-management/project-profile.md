# Project Profile: ReUseIt

ReUseIt is a mobile-first platform for recycling, reuse, and community coordination. The app helps users identify waste, locate recycling points, share reusable items, organize local events, and track contribution points and badges.

## Scope
Full software development lifecycle: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and documentation. Deliverable: cross-platform mobile app (React Native/Expo) with NestJS/GraphQL backend, MongoDB Atlas, and on-device TensorFlow Lite for waste identification.

## Target Audience
- Environmentally conscious individuals
- General public (seeking to donate or recycle items)
- New movers (relocating users needing to donate or find items)

## Project Objectives
- Waste identification: On-device AI for classifying recyclables
- Community engagement: Marketplace for giveaways, requests, and local events
- Education: Recycling guides and location services
- Gamification: Points, badges, and leaderboards for eco-friendly actions

## Risks & Mitigation
- ML integration: Mitigated by using TensorFlow Lite and fallback logic
- User adoption: Addressed with intuitive UI, gamification, and educational content
- Data security: Enforced with JWT, Firebase Auth, and encrypted communication

## Project Plan
Agile methodology with 2-week sprints, continuous feedback, and iterative releases.
